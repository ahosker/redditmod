## About Reddit Mod

I have a Niche Subreddit and think it would be useful for a GPT to reply to the questions users ask. It would be extremly useful to plug that into a dataset to get more accurate information.

I'd also like to see sentiment analysis to warn me of comments.

I'd also like to "tag" posts with a flare, if it is a Question, Informative Post, etc..
